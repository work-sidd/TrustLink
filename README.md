## ✨ Overview

💡 Why TrustLink?

In a world flooded with fancy packaging, sugar-coated reviews, and unclear ingredient labels, how do you know what you're really putting in your body or on your skin?
Whether you're buying supplements, cosmetics, or even that new protein bar from a local shop, transparency is missing—and consumers are paying the price.

TrustLink was born from that very gap.

We built TrustLink to be your personal watchdog across three domains:

🛒 Online Buyers, Rejoice

As you scroll Amazon or Flipkart, TrustLink's Chrome extension silently scans products in real-time. Spot a ⚠️ warning on a supplement? One click, and boom—you get verified lab test results, review authenticity checks, and a breakdown of cosmetic ingredients right on the product image.

🧠 Offline? Snap & Analyze

Found a snack or beauty product at a store? Just snap a photo of the label. Our AI-powered Label Analyzer breaks down ingredients—flagging what's safe, what’s shady, and what each component actually does.

💬 The Community Speaks

Still unsure? Head to the TrustLink Forum—a public space where users create threads, debate brands, expose shady products, or recommend trusted gems. Think Reddit meets Product Truth Serum.

Because transparency shouldn't be a luxury.

This is everyday impact.This is TrustLink.
